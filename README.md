Say goodbye to chaos and hello to peace ✌️ in your chat servers!

This bot is your all-in-one moderator for **Discord**, **Telegram**, and **WhatsApp**. It detects bad language, issues warnings, and can even ban repeat offenders. Plus, it's smart enough to talk to users about your community rules like a real mod should!
